                    Rabbit Mechanic was founded by logistics professionals and
                    built with real truckers in mind. Rabbit Mechanic is a
                    smart, all-in-one service application and website built
                    exclusively for Semi Trucks and Trailers, featuring an
                    intelligent Automatic Service Alert System that keeps your
                    fleet fully maintained and always road-ready. With Rabbit
                    Mechanic, you can effortlessly track detailed service
                    records for every vehicle, ensuring you stay updated on all
                    past maintenance and upcoming tasks. The system sends
                    real-time service reminders so you never miss critical
                    upkeep—including engine oil changes, wheel alignment (truck
                    and trailer), filter replacements (air, fuel, DEF, cabin),
                    tire rotations/replacements, tune-ups, transmission fluid,
                    and differential oil changes. It also delivers scheduled
                    alerts for full inspections, including brake checks and DOT
                    compliance, helping prevent breakdowns and costly regulatory
                    issues. Designed for both owner-operators and fleet
                    managers, Rabbit offers a powerful suite of tools like
                    maintenance history tracking, service scheduling, a fleet
                    dashboard, and access to on-site or mobile mechanics.
                    Whether you’re managing a single truck or an entire fleet,
                    Rabbit helps maximize uptime, reduce unexpected repairs, and
                    extend the life of your rigs—all from one easy-to-use
                    platform. Need a mechanic fast? Use Rabbit to find and
                    connect with nearby verified mechanics, perfect for both
                    emergency fixes and scheduled work. You can also track
                    trips, monitor mileage, and manage your driver team for full
                    operational visibility. Rabbit Mechanic is your trusted
                    digital co-pilot, making predictive maintenance and smart
                    fleet management simple, efficient, and stress-free.
